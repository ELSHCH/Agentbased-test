# Agent - based Model for a collective population of predator species with random resource domain 

 The code in Matlab is for the model of collective swarm motion where the positions of individuals
in the swarm is determined according to motion of center of mass of the swarm.
On the two dimensional domain of resources, the individuals move randomly
such that they are attracted to the center of mass of the whole group and have a mutual force of
repulsion for every pair of individuals; the resource domain is updated at every 
step depending on the positions of grazers.
